While working on the open source project, I brought a repo about three years ago.
Therefore, it was necessary to change the design in a trendy way, and we wanted to modify it to suit our project goals

We changed the existing old image to a simple style.

I modified the fancy font.
I added a school mark because I'm going to create a site for my school.

This allows us to make a slightly better project.
